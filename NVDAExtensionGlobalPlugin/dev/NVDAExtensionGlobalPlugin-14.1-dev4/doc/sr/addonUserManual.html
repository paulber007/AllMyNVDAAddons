<H3>1.2. Add-on configuration menu</H3>
<P>
In NVDA's "Preferences" sub-menu, the "NVDA global commands extension" sub-menu has been added which offers the following choices, depending on the case:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>systematically "Settings" which opens a dialog resembling the "parameters" dialog of NVDA and which presents the following categories:
 <UL>
 <LI>"Feature installation": allows you to see the installation status of each feature provided by the add-on and possibly modify it.
 <LI>"Complements to NVDA": to configure the options related to NVDA provided by the add-on,
 <LI>"Computer": to configure the options related to the functions relating to the computer (Windows operating system, volume control),
 <LI>"Keyboard": to configure the options linked to the keyboard (key remanence, use of the numeric keypad),
 <LI>"Advanced":options for experienced users,
 <LI>"update": settings controlling the update of the add-on.
 </UL>
<LI>"Keyboard keys renaming" (if the functionality is installed): allows you to modify the names of the keyboard keys given by default by NVDA as required,
<LI>"Selective announcement of the keyboard keys" (if the functionality is installed): allows the name of the keyboard keys to be announced selectively, as needed,
<LI>"Reset the configuration" to restore the configuration to its initial state when the add-on is first installed.
</UL>

<P>
This configuration is saved in two ways depending on the functionality or option concerned:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>in the "NVDAExtensionGlobalPluginAddon.ini" file placed in the user folder "userConfig" of NVDA for the configuration used regardless of the configuration profile,
<LI>in the NVDA.ini file or the configuration profile file of the profile triggered at the time of the modification for the configuration that will be used only when this profile is triggered.
</UL>

<P>
NVDA offers the option "Save configuration on exiting" (see NVDA user manual) which allows to automatically save NVDA configuration when exiting or restarting NVDA. If this option is not checked, the configuration is only saved upon user action or upon modification of a parameter that requires restarting NVDA.
</P>
<P>
This add-on follows this mode of operation.
</P>
<P>
Some add-on setting changes require saving the configuration and restarting NVDA. In this case, the user is offered to save and immediately restart as NVDA does when there is a change of language.
</P>
<P>
When uninstalling the add-on, its configuration file is deleted and the add-on's configuration is cleared from all configuration profiles.
</P>
<P>
When uninstalling a feature, its configuration, if any, is completely deleted.
</P>
<P>
In the case of an update, installing the add-on offers the possibility of keeping (as far as possible) or not the previous configuration.
</P>
<P>
Using the "Reset configuration" submenu, it is possible to restore the configuration to the same state as when the add-on was first installed, including the one saved in the configuration profiles.
</P>
<P>
This allows you to start from scratch without having to uninstall and reinstall the add-on in case of possible problems.
</P>
<A NAME="toc5"></A>
<H3>1.3. update</H3>
<P>
The update of the add-on is, by default, automatically a short time after the start of NVDA (between 20 and 600 seconds) and a maximum of once per day.
It is possible to disable this update by unchecking the option "automatically check for updates" of "Update" category in the add-on's settings.
The version of the add-on can be:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a stable version: its version number is "1.0" for example.
<LI>either a development version: the version number is of the type "1.0-dev1", or "1.0-rc1", or "1.0-beta2".
</UL>

<P>
By default, the stable version is updated with a stable version more recent (higher version number).
But it is possible to update the stable version running with a development version of the next stable version. Just check the option "Update also update the stable release to the versions of development" located in the "Update" category of add-on's settings.
</P>
<P>
A development version is updated:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>with a more recent development version,
<LI>with its stable version,
<LI>or with the latest stable version if the previous option is not checked.
</UL>

<P>
The button "Search for update" placed in the add-on's settings, menu item "Update", allows you to search immediately for an update.
</P>
<P>
The "View history" button, placed in this same category, allows you to display the history of the current version in the browser.
</P>
<P>
In the case of an automatic update and if a new version is detected, the "Update" dialog box is displayed to suggest:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>either the immediate installation of the new version,
<LI>or to postpone the update until later. In this case, the search will be restarted at least one hour later.
</UL>

<P>
In the case of an update to a stable version, the "What's new" button offers the possibility of opening, in the browser, the history of the add-on and thus being able to know the new features of the proposed version.
</P>
<A NAME="toc6"></A>
<H3>1.4. Safe mode operation</H3>
<P>
In this mode, the operation of the add-on is degraded.
</P>
<P>
Like NVDA, it is not possible to save configuration changes.
</P>
<P>
Some features are no longer available, such as:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>"Display of the list of icons in the notification area and windows of launched applications",
<LI>"NVDA logs",
<LI>"Development tools".
<LI>update of the add-on.
</UL>

<A NAME="toc7"></A>
<H3>1.5. Compatibility</H3>
<P>
The configuration of the "Voice profile switching" functionality having changed, it is deleted during an update from a version of the add-on older than 9.0. All selectors are released and the associated voice profiles are deleted.
</P>
<A NAME="toc8"></A>

<P></P>
Each category is a section defined as follows:
<LI>category name,
<LI>list of symbols (the symbol = its description)
<P></P>
The basic categories of the add-on with their symbols are defined in a "symbolCategories.dic" file specific to each language and which is located in the "xxx" folder of the "local" folder of the add-on (xxx being the identifier language,for example "fr" for French).
You can customize this add-on and create your own basic categories.
To do this, simply create in the userConfig folder, a "symbolCategories-xxx.dic" file, saved in "utf-8" encoding, (xx is the language code). In this file, the name of the categories will be defined between square brackets and each symbol as follows:
<LI>the symbol (a single character),
<LI>a tabulation ("Tab" character),
<LI>the description of the symbol (a string of characters).
</UL>

<P>
Empty or comment lines (starting with "#") are accepted.
</P>
<P>
These files are kept during an add-on update, even if the user asks not to keep their own settings.

<H3>2.9. Keyboard keys renaming</H3>
<P>
This feature is installed by default.
</P>
<P>
It allows you to rename certain keyboard keys as "Caps lock" or "Numeric lock" using a dialog box which presents:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>in a list, the keyboard keys with their label defined in NVDA,
<LI>The "Modify" button which allows you to modify the label of the key selected in the list and enter a replacement caption using a classic input dialog box.
</UL>

<P>
When a replacement label is defined for the selected key, the read-only edit box, reachable by "Tab", displays this replacement label. This label is announced when the key is focused.
</P>
<P>
The "Delete" button allows you to delete this replacement label.
</P>
<P>
It is also possible to delete this label by entering an empty or full string in the input box.
</P>
<P>
The "Delete all" button allows you to delete all the replacement labels to return to the basic labels provided by NVDA.
</P>
<P>
The "OK" button is used to apply the overrides and to save the keyboard keys and their replacement label in the add-on configuration file in the "RedefinedKeyLabels" section and the corresponding NVDA language subsection (" fr "for example for French). It is thus possible to have key renames for different languages.
</P>
<P>
To display this dialog, three possibilities:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>by selecting and activating the item "Keyboard keys renaming" of the "NVDA global commands extension" submenu,
<LI>with the "f2" command of the interpreter,
<LI>with the script "Display keyboard keys renaming dialog", provided without input gesture. A gesture can be assigned to it using the NVDA "input gesture" dialog.
</UL>

<A NAME="hdr13"></A>
<H3>2.10. Selective announcement of command keys</H3>
<P>
This feature is installed by default.
</P>
<P>
NVDA allows the command keys to be spoken by voice using the "Speek command keys" option located in the "Keyboard" category of the NVDA "Settings" dialog or by the  "NVDA + 4" input gesture.
</P>
<P>
This functionality provides, by configuration and using a dialog box, the possibility of:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>do not announce certain command keys when the "Speek command keys" option is checked,
<LI>announce certain command keys when the "Speek command keys" option is not checked.
</UL>

<P>
To display this dialog, three possibilities:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>by selecting and activating the item "Command selective announcement" in the "NVDA global commands extension" submenu,
<LI>using the "f3" command of the interpreter,
<LI>using the script "Display    command selective announcements dialog", provided without input gesture. An input gesture can be assigned to it using the NVDA "input gestures" dialog.
</UL>

<P>
The dialogue presents:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a checkbox to choose for which mode,the keys have been configured,
<LI>the list of possible keys,
<LI>the list of possible modifier key combinations with the additional "NVDA", "Alt", "Control", "Shift", "Windows" keys.
</UL>

<P>
Pressing the space bar checks or unchecks the selected key or combination.
</P>
<P>
If the "Speek command keys" box in the dialog box is not checked, checking a key will cause that key to announce anyway when NVDA is configured not to announce them.
</P>
<P>
The list of modifier key combinations is then accessible and all the elements in this list are checked by default.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the key typed with a particular combination from being announced, it suffices to uncheck this combination.
</P>
<P>
If the "none" item in the combination list is checked, the key will be announced even when pressed without a modifier key combination.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if the "Speek command keys" check box is checked, checking a key prevents this key from being announced when NVDA is configured to announce them.
</P>
<P>
The list of modifier key combinations is then accessible and all the elements of this list are checked by default. This means that the key typed with or without a combination will not be announced.
</P>
<P>
The action of unchecking a combination then makes it possible to announce the key with this combination.
</P>
<P>
The "none" element in the list of combinations makes it possible not to have the same key announced without a combination of modifier keys.
</P>
<P>
The "Uncheck all" and "Check all" buttons allow you to uncheck or check all the elements in the list of modifier key combinations.
</P>
<P>
The first item "any key with modifier key combination" in the list of keys allows, without designating a particular key, to select a set of modifier key combinations. Any key typed with one of these combinations will be announced or not, depending on the configuration mode chosen.
</P>
<P>
The "OK" button saves the choices made for the current configuration profile, while the "Cancel" button forgets them.
</P>
<P>
In the lists, the "F2" key and the "shift + F2" key combination allow you to move respectively to the next or previous checked item.
</P>
<P>
It is possible to not install this functionality by selecting, in the "Installed functionalities" category and for the "Selective announcement of command keys" functionality, the "Do not install" status.

<UL>
<LI>those which have been associated under the current configuration profile (its name is indicated in the title of the dialog),
<LI>those which have been associated under the normal configuration profile if the checkbox "Use the associated selectors under the normal configuration profile" is checked. The indication "normal configuration" is then indicated for these selectors.
</UL>

<P>
When the selector is indicated as "free", the "Associate voice profile" button allows you to associate the current voice profile with this selector. This button brings up a dialog box allowing you to give a name to this voice profile. A default name is proposed. The "Default" button allows you to return to this proposal.
</P>
<P>
When a selector is already associated with a voice profile, it is then possible:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>activate this voice profile with the "Activate voice profile" button: the profile becomes the current voice profile and the box closes.

Only the selectors associated under the current configuration profile can be released.
</P>
<P>
To quickly change voice profile, the "Voice profile switching" mode is set up.
</P>
<P>
To activate or deactivate this mode, the "p" command of the interpreter must be typed.
</P>
<P>
This mode activated,the right or left arrows are used to move to the first next or previous selector associated with a voice profile and thus define the voice profile associated with this selector as the current voice profile.

++ NVDA and modifier keys's remanence ++[hdr18]
This feature is not installed by default.
<P></P>
It allows to make the NVDA keys ("Insert" of the normal or extended numeric keypad,  "Caps Lock" key) and the modifier keys ("shift", "control", "left Alt", "Control right Alt" , "Windows") to be made peersistent.
<P></P>
The objective being to be able to use only one finger, for example, to compose a input gesture requiring the pressing of several keys.
<P></P>
It places a "Keys's remanence" grouping in the "Keyboard" category of the addd-on's "Settings" dialog.
<P></P>
To activate or deactivate keys's remanence, all you have to do is dial one of the following keyboard key sequences:
<LI>"Right shift", "Right control", "Right shift",
<LI>"left shift", "left control", "left shift".
<P></P>
Keys's remanence can be enabled automatically at  NVDAstart  by checking the "Activate remanence at NVDA's start" check box in the "Keys persistence" grouping.The activation or deactivation of afterglow is signaled by voice.
<P></P>
When remanence is activated, pressing one of the NVDA or modification keys triggers a timeout and the key is memorized.
This time delay can be configured using the "Remanence's delay (in milliseconds)" combobox in the "Keys' remanence" grouping.
<P></P>
It is also possible to limit the remanence to the single "NVDA" key by checking the "Only NVDA key in remanence" check box located in the same grouping. By default, this box is not checked and all modifier keys are sticky.
<P></P>
The start and end of this persistence is signaled by a beep which can be deactivated using the following check boxes in the "Key persistence" category:
<LI>"Play sound at the start of remanence",
<LI>"Play sound at the end of remanence".
</UL>

<P>
They are checked by default.
</P>
<P>
During this time delay, any further press on one of these keys restarts the time delay and this new key is also memorized, but no beep is emitted.
</P>
<P>
Pressing any other key on the keyboard executes the input gesture made up of the combination of all the keys memorized with this last key.
</P>
<P>
Each time this last key is pressed again during the timeout, the input gesture will be executed again.
</P>
<P>
If this key is typed out of time, it is executed alone and the memorized keys are forgotten.
</P>
<P>
Warning:
You have to wait for the end of afterglow to have any new key treated individually. For example: "Alt" to display a menu then expand the menu items.
</P>
<P>
It is however possible to stop the remanence before the end of the time delay, by re-entering the last key in remanence.
</P>
<A NAME="toc55"></A>
<H4>2.14.7. Specific remanence for the gmail.com site</H4>
<P>
This remanence is specifically set up for the gmail.com site and is only active in the "<A HREF="https://mail.google.com/mail/#i">https://mail.google.com/mail/#i</A>" page.
</P>
<P>
It is not active by default. A checkbox "Special remanence for Gmail.com" is provided in the "Keystroke persistence" grouping.
</P>
<P>
In this page, it is possible to type shortcuts to launch commands but some of them chain two letters. In particular, the letters "g", "h", "*" must be followed by another letter.
This sequence must be fast enough to trigger the execution of the associated command.
This is problematic for people who do not have sufficient dexterity.
</P>
<P>
The objective of this remanence is therefore to retain the first letter while waiting for the second to be struck.
</P>
<P>
When the first letter is struck, a time delay is started (a dull beep is heard) and the letter is stored.
</P>
<P>
Typing the second letter within the configured remanence delay will send both letters to the browser and the timeout is stopped.If no new letter is entered, the first letter is sent to the browser at the end of the time-out (a high-pitched beep is audible).
</P>
<P>
In order for NVDA to send the letters to the browser, it is necessary to switch to form mode first.
</P>

<H3>2.15. Computer shutdown</H3>
<P>
This feature cannot be uninstalled.
</P>
<P>
It installs a script whose description is: "Display dialog to shut down, reboot or hibernate the computer".
</P>
<P>
It is started using the "r" command of the interpreter.
This script displays a dialog consisting of the following elements:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a button to shut down the computer,
<LI>a button to reboot the computer,
<LI>a button to put the computer in hibernation,
<LI>a checkbox for, if it is checked (default state), requesting the closing without warning of all the applications launched when one of the first two buttons is pressed,
<LI>an edit field to define the delay before shutting down or restarting the computer.
</UL>

<P>
This feature also installs scripts corresponding to the functions of the three buttons.
</P>
<P>
All scripts are placed in the "NVDA global commands extension" category of the NVDA "input gestures" dialog, but no gestures are assigned to them.
</P>
<A NAME="hdr20"></A>
<H3>2.16. Management of user input gestures</H3>
<P>
This feature cannot be uninstalled.
</P>
<P>
Basically, NVDA allows you to add or remove input gestures using the "Input gestures" dialog. But there is no way to know which gestures are added or removed by the user.
</P>
<P>
This is what this functionality wants to meet.
</P>
<P>
To do this, it adds the script whose description is "Displays the dialog to manage the input gestures configured by user" and placed in the "NVDA global commands extension" category of the "input gestures" dialog of NVDA.
</P>
<P>
It is started using the "u" command of the interpreter. No control gesture is assigned to it by default.
</P>
<P>
This script displays an NVDA "input gestures" style dialog by selecting only the input gestures deleted or modified by the user.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue presents:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the classic tree structure which presents the control gestures by category and each script by its description,
<LI>a "Delete" button (active when a gesture is selected) to cancel the addition or deletion of the selected gesture,
<LI>a button to cancel all additions or deletion of input gestures.
</UL>

<P>
input gestures removed from a category are shown with the description: "input gestures removed".
</P>
<P>
As it is not possible to know the category and description of a deleted input gesture or of an added input gesture associated with a script of an add-on that is not activated or not installed at the time of the display of the dialogue, this gesture is presented like this:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the category is named: "name of the python module". Name of the python class "(for example: appModules.notepad ++. editWindow.EditWindow),
<LI>the description of the added input gestures is named: "name of the python script" (for example: goToPreviousBookmark).
</UL>

<P>
As for the classic "input gestures" dialog, it is only by pressing the "OK" button that all gesture deletions will be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
Cancellation of all changes using the "Delete all" button is subject to confirmation. Upon acceptance, all changes are canceled and the dialogue closes.

</P>
<P>
They are installed without input gestures. But it is still possible to assign them with the "input gestures" dialog.
</P>
<P>
They are started using the following interpreter commands:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>"up arrow" or "down arrow" to increase or decrease the volume,
<LI>"page up" or "page down" to maximize or minimize the volume.
<LI>a number from 1 to 9 to set the volume level at 10%, 20%, 30%, ..., 90% of the main volume.
</UL>

<P>
These commands, unlike the other interpreter commands, can be repeated without having to restart the interpreter. The interpreter is always active.
Once the volume level is reached, press the "Escape" key to exit the interpreter.
</P>
<P>
The increase or decrease in volume is done in steps.It is possible to adjust the size of these steps in the parameters of the add-on under the "Computer" category, "Volume control" grouping, by choosing the size of the step.
</P>
<P>
Size 1 is the smallest step, size 20 is the largest step. The size is set to 5 by default.
</P>
<P>
However, it should be understood that this pitch corresponds to a percentage increase or decrease in relation to the main volume.
</P>
<P>
So if the main volume is 100, the increase in application volume with a step of 5 will be 5 steps in the level of the Windows mixer.
</P>
<P>
Whereas if the main volume volume is 60, a step of 5 will increase the application volume by 3 steps.
</P>
<P>
The app volume level cannot exceed the master volume level.
</P>
<A NAME="toc62"></A>
<H4>2.17.4. Modify main volume</H4>
<P>
These scripts allow to increase, decrease, or fix the main volume.
</P>
<P>
They are installed without input gestures. But it is still possible to assign them with the "input gestures" dialog.
</P>
<P>
They are started using the following interpreter commands:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>"control+up arrow" or "control+down arrow" to increase or decrease the volume,
<LI>"control+page up" or "control+page down" to maximize or minimize the volume,
<LI>"control + a number from 1 to 9" to set the main volume level at 10, 20, 30, ..., 90,
</UL>

<P>
These commands, unlike the other interpreter commands, can be repeated without having to restart the interpreter. The interpreter is always active.
</P>
<P>
Once the volume level is reached, press the "Escape" key to exit the interpreter.
</P>
<P>
The increase or decrease in volume is done in steps. It is possible to adjust the size of these steps in the settings of the add-on under the  "Computer" category, grouping "Sound control", by choosing the size of the step.
Size 1 is the smallest step, size 20 is the largest step. By default, the size is set to 5, which corresponds to 5 steps of varying the volume in the Windows mixer.
</P>
<P>
The primary volume cannot fall below the configured recovery threshold.
</P>
<A NAME="toc63"></A>
<H4>2.17.5. Return to previous level</H4>
<P>
When using the preceding commands, the volume level is recorded before the execution of each command, for the main volume and for each application.
</P>
<P>
To return to this level, the following commands are available:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>"control+backspace": to reset the level of the main volume to the previous level.
<LI>"backspace": to reset the volume level of the application under focus to its previous level.
</UL>

<P>
The previous level is also saved when these commands are executed.
</P>
<P>
These records are not kept when restarting NVDA.
</P>
<A NAME="toc64"></A>
<H4>2.17.6. Announcement of level changes</H4>
<P>
Volume level changes are announced by default.But it is possible to deactivate this announcement using the "Report volume changes" option in the "Volume change" grouping of the "Computer" category.
</P>
<P>
For the volume of applications, this can be said:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>either as a percentage of the main volume,
<LI>or in absolute value (as in the Windows mixer).
</UL>

<P>
The choice is made using the "Announce application volume level in percent" option in the "Volume change" grouping in the "Computer" category.
</P>
<A NAME="toc65"></A>
<H4>2.17.7. Automatically restore main sound and NVDA when plugin loads</H4>
<P>
This function is used to restore, when loading this extension, the main volume and that of NVDA and to set the level of each volume to a value defined by configuration if it is lower than the minimum threshold defined by configuration.
</P>
<P>
For this, the "Sound control" group of the "Computer" category of the "Parameters" dialog of the extension, presents the following configuration elements:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the checkbox "Automatically set the main sound and NVDA when loading the extension" which enables or disables this option,
<LI>the restoration threshold of the main volume below which its level will be automatically restored,
<LI>the level of the main volume to restore,
<LI>the recovery threshold of the volume of NVDA below which its level will be restored,
<LI>the volume level of NVDA to restore.
</UL>

<P>
When launched, this extension verifies that the primary volume and the NVDA volume are above the recovery threshold configured for each.
</P>
<P>
If this is not the case, this extension then fixes the volume level to the value of the level to restore configured.
</P>
<P>
When installing this extension, the current levels of the main volume and NVDA are taken into account when setting the values ​​for the levels to be restored.
</P>
<A NAME="hdr23"></A>
<H3>2.18. Scripts for Clicking at the current navigator object position</H3>
<P>
These scripts allow you to do, with the right or left mouse button, a single or a double click at the current position of the navigator object.
</P>
<P>
They actually chain two types of NVDA scripts:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the script "Moves the mouse pointer to the current navigator object": "NVDA + / of the numeric keypad" (desktop computer) or" NVDA + upper case + m "(laptop),
<LI>and the scripts to click with the mouse button:
 <UL>
 <LI>simple left click: "/ from the numeric keypad" (desktop computer) or "NVDA + ù" (laptop and NVDA French language) or "NVDA +[" (laptop and other language).
 <LI>simple right click: "* from the numeric keypad" (desktop computer) or "NVDA + *" (laptop and NVDA French language) or "NVDA +]" (laptop and other language).
 </UL>
</UL>

<P>
The input gestures of these scripts are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>"nvda+,": make a simple left click at the position of the navigator object. The second press makes a double click.
<LI>"nvda+majuscule+,": make a simple right click at the position of the navigator object. The second press makes a double click.
</UL>

<P>
These input gestures can be changed and can be found in the "Mouse" category of the NVDA "input gestures" dialog.
</P>
<A NAME="hdr24"></A>
<H3>2.19. Complements concerning the date and time</H3>
<P>
This feature is installed by default without input gesture.
</P>
<P>
Warning: installed with a input gesture, this functionality may conflict with the "Clock" add-on because the "nvda + f12" input gesture is common.
</P>
<P>
This feature brings:
</P>
<A NAME="toc68"></A>
<H4>2.19.1. Copy date and time to clipboard</H4>
<P>
The description of this script is: "Copy date and time to clipboard".
This script is stored in the "System Status" category of the NVDA "input gestures" dialog.
</P>
<P>
It is started using the "c" command of the interpreter.
No input gesture is attributed to it.
</P>
<P>
As its description indicates, it allows you to copy the date and time to the clipboard.
</P>
<A NAME="toc69"></A>
<H4>2.19.2. Script to replace the base script "NVDA + f12"</H4>
<P>
The extension installs a script whose description is: "Reports the current time. Twice, reports the current date. Third: copy date and time to the clipboard".
</P>
<P>
This script is stored in the "System status" category of the "input gestures" NVDA dialog.
</P>
<P>
No interpreter command is associated with it.
</P>
<P>
If the extension's install status is "Install", this script replaces the NVDA script and is started using the "NVDA + f12" command gesture.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise no command gesture is assigned to it, but it is still possible to assign it using the NVDA "Command gestures" dialog.
</P>
<P>
This script allows:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>at the first press of the gesture: the announcement of the current time.
<LI>the second press: the announcement of the current date.
<LI>on the third press: copy of the current date and time to the clipboard.
</UL>

<P>
It also brings:
</P>
<H5>2.19.2.1. Announcement of the hour independent of the punctuation level</H5>
<P>
The basic command gesture "NVDA + f12" gives the time with a simple press, but the time is not announced in the same way depending on the Level of punctuation and symbols selected in the voice parameters.
</P>
<P>
This script corrects this small flaw by announcing the time with the Level of punctuation and symbols forced to "None" without modifying the level defined in the "Speech" category's parameters.
</P>
<H5>2.19.2.2. Announcement of the time with seconds</H5>
<P>
By default, NVDA's command gesture "nvda + f12" announces the time without the seconds.
</P>
<P>
This script offers the possibility of announcing the time in seconds.
</P>
<P>
All you have to do is check the "Report windows clock's time with seconds" checkbox in the "Computer" category of the add-on's Settings dialog. This option is not checked by default.
</P>
<P>
This option is not present if the installation status of the feature is "Do not install".
</P>
<A NAME="hdr25"></A>
<H3>2.20. Emulation of the "Applications" key</H3>
<P>
To compensate for the absence of the "Applications" key on some computers and not knowing whether the "upper case + f10" shortcut fulfills the same function, the add-on installs a script without a input gesture in the "Emulated keys of the keyboard" category system "with the description"Emulate key press: applications".
</P>
<P>
To use it, all you need to do is assign it a input gesture or a keyboard key that is rarely used, such as the "print screen" key, the "Pause" key.
</P>
<A NAME="hdr26"></A>
<H3>2.21. Close all windows</H3>
<P>
The add-on installs a script to close all open windows.
</P>
<P>
This script is placed in the add-on scripts category and under the description "Close all opened windows".
</P>
<P>
It is started with the command "k" from the command interpreter. No control gesture is assigned to it by default.
</P>
<A NAME="hdr27"></A>
<H3>2.22. List of running add-on</H3>
<P>
The add-on manager displays the list of installed add-on and their status: activated or deactivated.
</P>
<P>
But even though it is enabled, an add-on may not be loaded by NVDA. Usually the NVDA log reports this, but nothing in the Extensions Manager.
</P>
<P>
It can be interesting at some point to know which add-on are actually running.
</P>
<P>
To do this, the add-on installs a script under the description "Display running add-ons list" in the category of add-on in the "input gestures" dialog.
</P>
<P>
This script is started with the "e" command of the command interpreter. No control gesture is assigned to it.
</P>
<P>
add-on are listed by type:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>global add-on type: it is an add-on which provides additional accessibility whatever the application under focus.
<LI>application add-on type: this is an add-on that provides additional accessibility for a specific application.
<LI>speech synthesis driver add-on type:it is an add-on which installs a driver for a speech synthesis.
<LI>Braille display driver add-on type: this is an add-on that installs a driver for a braille display.
<LI>mixed add-on type: it is an add-on which mixes the various previous add-on types.
</UL>

<A NAME="hdr22"></A>
<H3>2.23. Development tools</H3>
<P>
This feature is not installed by default.
</P>
<P>
It installs the script whose description is "Display tools for add-on development dialog".
</P>
<P>
This script is stored in the "Tools" category of the NVDA "input gestures" dialog.
</P>
<P>
This script is started using the "t" command of the interpreter. No control gesture is assigned to it.
</P>
<P>
Activating this script brings up a dialog presenting:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the list of installed add-ons,
<LI>a button to update, for the selected add-on, the version defined in the buildVars.py file,
<LI>a button to update the "manifest.ini" file of the selected add-on with information from its "buildVars.py" file,
<LI>a button to create, for the selected add-on, the catalog file (.pot),
<LI>a button to prepare the selected add-on (performs several actions at once),
<LI>the list of languages ​​supported by the selected add-on,
<LI>a button to create, for the selected add-on, the localization "manifest.ini" file for one or all the languages ​​it supports,
<LI>a button to create, for the selected add-on, its documentation files in HTML,
<LI>a button to create, for the selected add-on, the "buildVars.py" file from the information in its manifest.ini file,
<LI>a button to open the folder of the selected add-on in the explorer.
</UL>

<A NAME="toc74"></A>
<H4>2.23.1. Notions</H4>
<P>
To package an add-on (create the add-on installation file), we recommend that you use the "nvda adon scons template".
This model uses a "buildVars.py" file which defines, for an add-on, all the necessary information such as: its internal name, its version, its name and its description to be translated into each language supported by it.
This model is also used to allow the translation of add-on strings with the translation system set up by the "NVDA-addon.org" community.
</P>
<P>
The objective of this model is, when an add-on has been developed, by a simple command and after having informed the "buildVars.py" file of:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>create the manifest.ini file ",
<LI>create all the localization "manifest.ini" files,
<LI>compile all the .po files,
<LI>create the html documentation files,
<LI>finally create the add-on installation .nvda-addon file.
</UL>

<P>
When we create an add-on, there is nothing. You must create the "manifest.ini" file yourself, possibly the localization "manifest.ini" file and the documentation file.The objective of these tools is placed in this condition and is:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>on the one hand, to get closer to the "adon scons template" so that it is easy enough to package the add-on that we have finished developing,
<LI>on the other hand, to test all or part before using the model to create the add-on.
</UL>

<A NAME="toc75"></A>
<H4>2.23.2. Creation of the buildVars.py file</H4>
<P>
The first step is to create the "buildVars.py" file from the information in the "manifest.ini" file that we created for the development of the add-on.
</P>
<P>
The "Create the buildVars.py file" button starts this operation.
</P>
<P>
It is only this file that we will then modify to update the "manifest.ini" file (change of version or description for example).
</P>
<P>
To be used with the "adon scons template", it will have to be completed by filling in the information which is not found in the "manifest.ini" file.
</P>
<A NAME="toc76"></A>
<H4>2.23.3. Updated version of the add-on</H4>
<P>
The "Update add-on version" button allows you to modify the version defined in the buildVars.py file of the selected add-on.
</P>
<P>
It presents a dialog box containing an edit zone initialized with the current version of the file.
</P>
<P>
Pressing the "OK" button saves the new version in the file.
</P>
<A NAME="toc77"></A>
<H4>2.23.4. Updated manifest.ini</H4>
<P>
The "manifest.ini" file must be updated as soon as the "buildVars.py" file is modified.
</P>
<P>
Use the "Update manifest.ini file" button for this.
</P>
<A NAME="toc78"></A>
<H4>2.23.5. Creation of localization "manifest.ini" file</H4>
<P>
Any modification of the "addon_summary" or "addon_description" information of the "buildVars.py" file requires the translation of this description into each language supported by the extension (taken into account in the nvda.po file and compilation of this file) .
</P>
<P>
In order for the add-ons' Manager to present this information to the user for the language chosen for NVDA, you must create or update the localization "manifest.ini" file for that language.
</P>
<P>
The button "Create the localization manifest.ini file" allows this. It is possible to update the file for the selected language or for all languages.
</P>
<A NAME="toc79"></A>
<H4>2.23.6. Create HTML documentation</H4>
<P>
Add-oon documentation files can be either in "markdown" (. Md) or "txt2tags" (.t2t) format.
</P>
<P>
To be presented to the user in a browser, these files must be converted to HTML.
</P>
<P>
This is possible simply using the "Create HTML documentation files" button after selecting the add-on in the list of add-ons and choosing a language or all the languages ​​in the list of languages.
</P>
<P>
Opened in the browser, these HTML files need style files (style.css for Markdown files and style_t2t.css for txt2tags files) placed in the add-on's "doc" folder.
</P>
<A NAME="toc80"></A>
<H4>2.23.7. Creation of the catalog file</H4>
<P>
The "Create POT file" button is used to create the catalog file for the selected add-on.
</P>
<P>
Once created, this file is placed in the add-on's "locale\en" folder and is named "version-name.pot" where "name" is the name of the extension and "version" is its version.
</P>
<A NAME="toc81"></A>
<H4>2.23.8. Preparation of the add-on</H4>
<P>
The "Prepare add-on" button launches, for the selected add-on, the execution of the following actions:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>update of its "manifest.ini" file from the "buildVars.py" file,
<LI>creation of the localization "manifest.ini" file for each supported language,
<LI>creation of HTML documentation files,
<LI>creation of the catalog file.
</UL>

<P>
+++ Exploration of the add-on +++ folder
The "Explore add-on folder" button opens Windows Explorer in the selected add-on folder.
</P>
<A NAME="toc82"></A>
<H2>3. Options</H2>
<A NAME="hdr100"></A>
<H3>3.1. Removed the announcement of the description of objects in Windows ribbons</H3>
<P>
In Windows ribbons, NVDA is too chatty unnecessarily.
By default, this add-on prevents the advertisement of the description which seems quite unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
But this can be disabled using the "No object description inWindows ribbons" option found in the "Computer" category of the "add-on settings" dialog.
</P>
<P>
A restart of NVDA will then be necessary for the option to be taken into account.
</P>
<A NAME="hdr101"></A>
<H3>3.2. Announcement of the focused word after a word deletion</H3>
<P>
In some applications such as WordPad, Microsoft Word, it is possible to delete the following word with the command "control + Del", but versions of NVDA prior to 2020.3 do not pronounce the word following the cursor position after the deletion.
</P>
<P>
By default, this add-on allows these versions of NVDA to speak this word.
</P>
<P>
For these versions, this can be prevented by unchecking the "Report next word on deletion" option from the "NVDA enhancement" category of the  add-on's "Settings" dialog.
</P>
<A NAME="hdr102"></A>
<H3>3.3. Automatic window maximization</H3>
<P>
This option automatically maximizes windows that are brought to the foreground.
</P>
<P>
By default, it is enabled.
</P>
<P>
You can deactivate it by unchecking the option "Automatically maximize windows " in the "Computer" category of the "Settings" dialog of the add-on.
</P>
<A NAME="hdr103"></A>
<H3>3.4. Announcement of punctuation when moving by word</H3>
<P>
NVDA allows you to move word by word in documents using the "control + right arrow" and "control + left arrow" keyboard commands.
</P>
<P>
The symbols and punctuation marks are then said according to the level of punctuation and symbols configured for the current configuration profile.
</P>
<P>
This option allows you to configure the level of symbols and punctuation that will be used only when moving by word.
</P>
<P>
This choice is saved for the current configuration profile.It is configured in the "NVDA enhancement" category of the add-on's "Settings" dialog and named "Punctuation/symbol level on word movement".
</P>
<P>
It is only present if the "Announcement of the function associated with the" copy "," Paste "style editing commands is installed.
</P>
<P>
It is presented in the form of a combobox which allows you to choose:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>either the level of symbols and punctuation of the current configuration level (selected by default),
<LI>or one of NVDA's symbol and punctuation levels (None, some one, most, all).
</UL>

<A NAME="toc87"></A>
<H2>4. Advanced options</H2>
<A NAME="hdr300"></A>
<H3>4.1. Signaling by sound of an error in the NVDA log</H3>
<P>
Experienced users may have noticed that when using a development version of NVDA (snapshot master or next version), any error entered in the NVDA log is signaled with a sound. But with final versions or candidate releases, this signal is not emitted.
</P>
<P>
This option offers the choice between:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>broadcast the sound signal whatever the version of NVDA,
<LI>never to broadcast the signal,
<LI>to broadcast the signal only until the next start of NVDA,
<LI>broadcast the signal only for development versions.
</UL>

<P>
To make this choice, all you have to do is select the option in the combobox list named "Play sound on logged errors" in the "Advanced" category of the "Settings" dialog of the add-on.
By default, the option "Only for development versions" is selected.
</P>
<A NAME="hdr302"></A>
<H3>4.2. Titling of dialog boxes with the name of the add-on</H3>
<P>
This option allows you to title or not the dialog boxes of this add-on with its name.
It can be found in the "Advanced" category of the "Settings" dialog.
</P>
<P>
By default, this option is checked and the title of the boxes is in the form: "NVDA global commands extension - NVDA - dialog title".
</P>
<A NAME="hdr303"></A>
<H3>4.3. Configuration of the delay for waiting for repetition of the same input gesture</H3>
<P>
Some scripts in this add-on perform different actions depending on the number of times the input gesture associated with the script is dialed.
The repetition of the control gesture must be done within a short time (500 ms by default).
</P>
<P>
For a script performing three different actions, the mechanism is:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>At the first press, the time delay is started,
<LI>if there is no second press before the end of the time delay, the first action is carried out. Otherwise the time delay is restarted on this second press.
<LI>if there is no third press before the end of the time delay, the second action is carried out. Otherwise, the timer is stopped and the third action is performed.
</UL>

<P>
Depending on the user's dexterity or the hardware configuration, this timeout may be too long or too short.
</P>
<P>
The option entitled "Delay between repeat of same gesture" in the "Advanced" category of the "Settings" dialog of the add-on allows you to adjust this timeout as needed.
</P>
<A NAME="hdr304"></A>
<H3>4.4. Standard use of the numeric keypad</H3>
<P>
By default, NVDA uses certain keys on the numeric keypad, such as the arrow keys, the "multiply", "divide" keys, and the "plus" key, to activate scripts.
</P>
<P>
The objective is to restore to each key of the numeric keypad, temporarily or permanently, its normal functioning, composed alone or with a modification key such as "control", "Alt", "capital" (The "NVDA" key is excluded).
</P>
<P>
These keys are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>the "right and left arrow" keys,
<LI>the "up and down arrows" keys,
<LI>the "previous and next page" keys,
<LI>the "start and end" keys,
<LI>the "multiply" and "divide" keys,
<LI>the "More" button.
</UL>

<P>
To enable or disable the use of the numeric keypad in standard operation and if the option "allow the standard use of the numeric keypad" in the "Numeric keypad" grouping of the "Keyboard" category is checked, the add-on offers:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>a script whose description is "Enable or disable the standard use of numeric keypad". No input gesture is assigned to it by default.
<LI>the "f5" command from the command interpreter.
<LI>activation by two successive presses on the "Num lock" key if the option "Enable / disable numeric keypad's standard use with num lock key" ("Numeric Keypad" grouping, "Keyboard" category) is checked.
</UL>

<P>
The  "Enable the standard use of the numeric keypad at NVDA's start" option ("Numeric keypad" grouping, " Keyboard " category), allows, if it is checked, to use the numeric keypad as standard from the start of NVDA , but the option that allows standard use of the numeric keypad must also be checked.
</P>
<A NAME="toc92"></A>
<H2>5. Other improvements</H2>
<A NAME="hdr202"></A>
<H3>5.1. Exploring the user configuration folder or nvda program folder</H3>
<P>
This add-on adds in the "tools" menu of NVDA a sub-menu "Explore NVDA" which offers two choice items:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>"explore my configuration folder": to open your user configuration folder in Windows explorer.
<LI>"Explore the program folder": to open the NVDA program folder in the explorer.
</UL>

<P>
Two scripts, placed in the "NVDA global commands extension" category of the NVDA "input gestures" dialog, are provided to perform these same actions and with the following descriptions:
</P>
<UL>
<LI>"Explor my user configuration's folder",
<LI>"Explore NVDA programs's folder".
</UL>

<P>
By default, no input gesture is associated with them.
</P>
<A NAME="hdr203"></A>
<H3>5.2. Presentation of text formatting in a dialog</H3>
<P>
Basically, a double press of the "NVDA + f" input gesture presents the formatting information in the form of an HTML document.
</P>
<P>
This script aims to complete them and display them instead in a dialog box so that they can be read using the arrows keys.
</P>
<P>
It is started using the "f" command of the interpreter.
</P>
<P>
The description of the script is: "Display formatting info for the current review cursor position within a document in dialog box".
</P>
<P>
It is stored under the "NVDA global commands extension" heading of the "NVDA input gestures" dialog.
</P>
<P>
No input gesture is assigned to it by default.
</P>

<H3>5.3. Announcement of the text of confirmation style dialog boxes</H3>
<P>
NVDA considers some dialog boxes, such as confirmation dialogs, that the text they contain is a description.
</P>
<P>
So if the "Announce object description" option in the "Object overview" category of the NVDA "Settings" dialog is not checked, the text is not announced by NVDA.
</P>
<P>
This add-on implements the  "Do not take account of the option called Report object descriptions during the display of the dialog box style confirmation" option  in the "Advanced" category of the "Settings" dialog of the add-on to force, if checked, the announcement of the text of these boxes in all cases. This option is checked by default.
